# SPCF-Spam_Classifier : UNDER DEVELOPMENT
A Basic Spam Classifier for LINUX 64-bit system

The application is designed to be controlled by terminal..<br>
This application takes the Gmail username and password and then downloads all the mails of a particular Gmail folder 
as desired by the user and then classifies the mails as Spam or Not-Spam based on the dictionaries it has.
<br>
The dictionaries are made dynamic in V-1.0.1. So, now the dictionaries get automatically updated when new mails are processed..
<br>
<h3>Requisites</h3>
<ul>
<li>Internet Connection</li>
<li>IMAP enabled on Gmail</li>
<li>64-bit LINUX version</li>
<li>Python 2.7</li>

<h3>Installation</h3>
Download all the files from <a href="https://github.com/pakhandi/SPCF-Spam_Classifier">here</a> and then run the <b>init.sh</b> file folder from terminal,

<ul>
<li>Download all the mails of a single Gmail folder into a clean arrangement in the local system</li>
<li>Run programs to create two folders for Spam mails and Non-Spam mails and copy respective mails to the folders</li>
</ul>

<li>The application is made using Python-2.7.9, C++ and Shell scripting</li>
</ul>
