# SPCF-Spam_Classifier
A Basic Spam Classifier for LINUX 64-bit system

The application is designed to be controlled by terminal..<br>
This application takes the Gmail username and password and then downloads all the mails of a particular Gmail folder 
as desired by the user and then classifies the mails as Spam or Not-Spam based on the dictionaries it has.
<br>
The dictionaries are made dynamic in V-2.0.0. So, now the dictionaries get automatically updated when new mails are processed..
